# Daily Work Schedule


## Overview

Everything for the homework assignment is working properly. Users will be able to insert an event and that user input 
will be saved to local storage once the save button is clicked. To delete an entry, all the user needs to do is delete 
the saved data entry and hit save. Upon reload, the data will be gone. All time blocks are color coordinated for past (grey),
present(red), and future (green). The date is clearly displayed at the top of the page.
